# Docker Compose Override YAML fragment that can be used for development
#
# It will:
#
# - set the number of replicas to 0 for all containers where the equivalent
#   will be run outside of docker or is not needed; this includes traefik,
#   reev, postgres, redis, ...
# - expose the containers that you need runing in docker at the following
#   ports:
#   - `3001` -- annonars
#   - `3002` -- mehari
#   - `3003` -- viguno
#   - `3004` -- nginx

  # map annonars to port 3001

    ports:
      - "3001:8080"

  # map mehari to port 3002

    ports:
      - "3002:8080"

  # map viguno to port 3003
